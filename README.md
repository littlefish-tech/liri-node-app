### This is so far one of my favorite project. I am practising Javascript and I am alway can see how Javascript is running at the backend. When I see the result I am looking for running in the console, I feel very excited. The process to find problem, thinking about fixing the problem and finally fixed the problem is really fun.

### Below is the steps about how I finish this project.
- I created my own spotify account to have my own spotify ID and secrets
- I put my own spotify ID and secrets in a sepreate file called .env
- I have also created a file called .gitignore, and I add some files' names in that then, then the public will not see the content in those files
- I created 4 actions and put them under switch method, the 4 actions are:
    1. concert-this
    2. spotify-this-song
    3. movie-this
    4. do-what-it-says

## below are some gifs about how the information is showing in the Terminal
